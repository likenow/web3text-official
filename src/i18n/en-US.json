	"qal4": "Any transaction happens on the blockchain requires “Gas Fee” which is used to reward miners for maintaining the decentralized network.",
	"qal5": "The NFT project is a free mint project, however, minting an NFT still needs miners from blockchain to finish jobs such as executing, validating and etc. As a result, gas fee is unavoidable.",
	"qal6": "What needs to be mentioned is that the gas fee fluctuates all the time. You would notice that the “gas fee” section in MetaMask keeps refreshing. Why is that?",
	"qal7": "This is because there's a capacity limit on each block and not all the transactions will be packed in time. Miners would always pack transactions with higher gas fee first. Hence, the more gas fee you pay, the faster your transaction will be completed.",
	"qal8": "We would recommend you to mint when the gas fee is low. In this case, it will save you some ETH. You can check live gas fee on https://etherscan.io/gastracker 15 to 40 Gwei is a good gas fee range for minting.",
